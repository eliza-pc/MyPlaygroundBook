 # Challege One - The Photosintesis Process
 
 The photosinthesis is the process where some plants and other beigns take some water,  light enerny and carbon dioxide to feed themselves. What means that the plants in our playground are really hungry, Mr. Carbon Dioxide suggested that you can feed them here throught something called code so he will give you a hand in orde to complete that.
 
 
 
 **Feeding the Plants**
 You can feed the plants by adding some foods that photosintesis provides like:
 
 - **Note:** Remember, healthy foods make your weight go down by **10** and unhealthy foods increase it by **10**. Healthy habits make your cholesterol go down by **10** and unhealthy habits increase it by **10**.
