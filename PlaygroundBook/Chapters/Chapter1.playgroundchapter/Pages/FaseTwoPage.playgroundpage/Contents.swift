 # Chapter Two: The Food Web x CO2
 
 The **food web** is the interconnection of beings so that energy and nutrients flow from one to the next. This is one of the **most important** things to the maintenance of the many lives in our planet. Because when some animal disappear consequently another may disappear too.
 
 Mr. Carbon Dioxide will travel all over the bodies of all the beings on the scene and then go to the next chapter. In order to do that he recomended that you **feed the beings** on the scene to maintain the food web and the flow.
 
 - **Note:** **Fred the cow** will consume the plants that are already with CO2 to and **Padme the human** will consume the Fread's meat so they can maintain their subsistence. Later, Padme will realease **atmospheric carbon** throught her **cellular respiration**.
