 # A note about empathy
 
 As you may see along all this journey the carbon dioxide is present in the most of things in our planet. Everything is **connected** to each other. One thing can give life to another! And to maintain this perfect ballance we need to stay sensible about it.
 
 Just because we are not seeing this cycle, doesn’t mean to say that it’s not happening. The CO2 can make a **great harm** to our atmospheric when realeased in abundance but can do greats when balanced. We saw that the trees captures the most of the carbon dioxide realeased by things in our planet and this minimazes the harm that CO2 can do.
 
 At the end all, this Playground Book it's not only about the CO2 life cycle it is about **empathy**, it’s about life and staying together. All the things matter and is important just like you. Be empathic, stay empathic.
 
**Thank You, hope you've enjoy it.**
