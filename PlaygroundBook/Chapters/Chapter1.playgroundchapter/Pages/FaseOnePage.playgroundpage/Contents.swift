 # Chapter One: The Photosintesis Process

 The **photosintesis** is the process where the **light energy** provided by the sun give some **water** and **CO2** to the chlorophyll beings, in order to feed them with something called glucose.
 
 One of these beings are **plants** and **Mr. Carbon Dioxide said** that you need to add some of these elemets to the scene so that he can get his way done through this chapter.

- **Note:** The Carbon Dioxide is passed to the plants by photosintesis and goes through all the **food web**. The factory realeases atmospheric CO2 by combustion of fossil fuels which ends up polluting the air.
